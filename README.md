# About #

### UIKit Artwork ###
*UIKit Artwork Extractor* extracts all the artwork contained in UIKit into png files.

The png files are saved into `~/Desktop/UIKit Artwork Extractor-version` where *version* is the SDK version.

### Glossy Buttons ###
*UIKit Artwork Extractor* can also generate glossy buttons png files. Thanks to [@schwa](http://twitter.com/schwa/status/9288691077) for the original code. Glossy buttons png files are saved into the same directory as UIKit artwork png files.

# Known issues #

Currently, *UIKit Artwork Extractor* can only extract 2.x and 3.0 SDKs artwork files. Versions 3.1 and later are not yet supported.
