# UIKit Artwork #
*UIKit Artwork Extractor* extracts all the artwork and emoji symbols contained in UIKit into png files.

In order to extract *Retina Display @2x* high resolution images, choose the **Hardware > Device > iPhone 4** menu in the iPhone Simulator.

The png files are saved into `~/Desktop/UIKit Artwork Extractor-version` where *version* is the SDK version.

# Glossy Buttons #
*UIKit Artwork Extractor* can also generate glossy buttons png files. Thanks to [@schwa](http://twitter.com/schwa/status/9288691077) for the original code. Three states (normal/highlighted/disabled) glossy buttons png files are saved into the same directory as UIKit artwork png files.
